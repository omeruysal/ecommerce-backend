# Ecommerce-backend (Node.Js)
**Before start**, I want to make it clear, if you are looking for **solid business logic** or **best practices** with Node.js you should check my another repository [Tour-Api-With-NodeJs](https://github.com/omeruysal/API-Nodejs ) because on Ecommerce project I aimed to focus on mobile part mostly. That is why I created backend part as soon as possible and skipped some steps. G.e. I skipped service layer.
